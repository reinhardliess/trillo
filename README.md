# Trillo â€“ A Website for a Fictional All-In-One Booking App

## Description

In this project, while following along with the excellent _Advanced CSS and Sass_ [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/), I built a landing page for a fictional all-in-one booking app called "Trillo".

A live version can be accessed [here](https://rliess-trillo.netlify.app/).

The original course website can be found at <https://trillo.netlify.app/>.
